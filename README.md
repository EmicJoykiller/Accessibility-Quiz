Key Features and Components:

HTML Structure:
The HTML structure includes semantic elements such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <form>, and <footer> to provide a clear and organized layout.
Accessibility features like aria-labelledby, role="region", and aria-hidden are utilized to enhance screen reader compatibility and improve navigation for users with disabilities.
Navigation and User Input:
The navigation menu (<nav>) allows users to jump to specific sections of the quiz using anchor links (<a>).
Input elements like text fields, radio buttons, and a dropdown menu are included in the quiz form, enabling user interaction and response submission.
Styling and Responsiveness:
CSS styles are applied to enhance the visual appeal and responsiveness of the webpage across different devices and screen sizes.
Media queries ensure that the layout and design adapt effectively to varying viewport widths, maintaining readability and usability.
Accessibility Enhancements:
Keyboard accessibility is implemented through accesskey attributes on navigation links, facilitating navigation using keyboard shortcuts.
ARIA attributes (aria-labelledby, role="region") are utilized to provide descriptive labels and landmarks for screen readers, improving the overall accessibility of the content.
The use of semantic HTML elements and proper form labels (<label>) ensures a more accessible and user-friendly experience for all users.
Purpose and Learning Goals:

The project serves as a practical learning experience for understanding and implementing accessibility best practices in web development.
Participants of the freeCodeCamp Accessibility course can apply their knowledge of ARIA attributes, keyboard shortcuts, and design considerations to create an inclusive and accessible quiz interface.
Through this project, developers gain hands-on experience in building accessible web content, contributing to a more inclusive online environment for users of all abilities.
Conclusion:
The "Accessibility Quiz" project underscores the importance of web accessibility in creating an inclusive digital experience. By leveraging HTML, CSS, and accessibility features, the project demonstrates how developers can design and develop accessible web content that caters to diverse user needs and promotes inclusivity in digital spaces.
